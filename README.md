# ExpandedRoofing [![RimWorld Alpha 17](https://img.shields.io/badge/RimWorld-Alpha%2017-brightgreen.svg)](http://rimworldgame.com/) 

Adds customizable roofing, with transparent greenhouse roofing and photovoltaic solar roofing. Reworked from Vendan's original idea.

## Features
- Transparent roofs that let almost all light through
- Solar roofs that can be used to generate power
- Solar controller that provides power from each solar roofing panel

## Notes
- New designators are in the `Zone` tab
- Due to how roofs are implement, it's easist to rezone default roofing to new types
- Only a single controller can be connected to a section of solar roofing
- Each solar roofing panel generates 50w

## Requirements
- HugsLib
