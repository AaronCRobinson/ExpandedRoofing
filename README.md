# ExpandedRoofing [![RimWorld Alpha 18](https://img.shields.io/badge/RimWorld-Alpha%2018-brightgreen.svg)](http://rimworldgame.com/)

Adds customizable roofing, with transparent greenhouse roofing and photovoltaic solar roofing. Reworked from Vendan's original idea.

## Features
- Transparent roofs that let almost all light through
- Solar roofs and controllers that can be used to generate power
- Removal of thick roofs
- Thick roofs
- 4 new techs to research for each of these features.

## Solar Roofing and Controllers explained
- Each controller has a max output of 2500w
- Each solar tile produces 200w during full sun
- There is no limit to the number of controllers connected to a section of tiles

## Notes
- New designators are in the `Zone` tab
- Due to how roofs are implement, it's easist to rezone default roofing to new types

## Translations
- English
- Turkish (by Slevilex)
- Russian (by Garr Incorporated)
- French (by Jozay)
